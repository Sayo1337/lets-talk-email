Welcome to Let's Talk Email! In this very special episode, co-hosts Steven and Jay welcome their first official guest: Megan Boshuyzen, Development Lead at Inbox Army.

Megan joins us to discuss her recent move from an in-house, brand-side role to the fast-paced world of an email agency. We dive deep into the differences between the two environments, from the level of freedom and scope of work to the sheer volume and variety of email challenges you face when developing for multiple clients. Plus, Megan shares her experience designing new email design systems and adapting to the different demands of agency life.
