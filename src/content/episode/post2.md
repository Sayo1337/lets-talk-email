Welcome to Let's Talk Email, the brand new podcast where Jay and I dive into everything email. In this episode, we're getting to the bottom of the email font debate. We're talking `@import`, `<link>`, and `@font-face` and the pros and cons of each method. We're also talking about the infamous German GDPR case, and the importance of fallback font stacks.

Whether you're new to email coding or a seasoned veteran, there's always something new to learn in this world of pixels and code. So, let's talk email!
